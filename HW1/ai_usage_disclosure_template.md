## AI Tool #1

### Tool Name
ChatGPT

### Version/Model
GPT-5

### Date(s) Used
September 10-11, 2025

### Specific Parts of Assignment
[Describe exactly which portions of your work involved AI assistance]
Used to write the the portion of the print function that prints the stack. 

### Prompts Used
[Provide the exact prompts/questions you asked the AI tool]
What is the stack and what do each of the numbers represent on each side of the vertical bar? How can we properly implement the stack in our print statement within our existing print statement? (Inputted the HW1 pdf for example outputs)

### AI Output/Results
[Describe what the AI tool provided in response]
AI explained where the stack values are coming from and what is happening on each side of the |. It gave the code to complete the printing of the stack values.

### How Output was Verified/Edited
[Explain how you verified accuracy, made modifications, or tested the AI output]
We tested the AI code with the sample values and made some modifications to match our variables. 
[e.g., Tested the corrected code with sample inputs; Verified encryption explanations against textbook; Implemented suggested security measures and tested functionality]

### Multiple Iterations (if applicable)
[If you used AI tools multiple times, provide a dialogue/conversation summary]
We first asked to explain what the stack was and how it was represented. Then we asked for sample code to show how we could integrate it into our existing print function, since we were having difficulty getting the full conditional logic for printing the stack.

### Learning & Reflection
[Reflect on what you learned and how the AI assistance contributed to your understanding]
Initially we were confused about what the two sets of numbers separated by the | meant, so AI helped alleviate this confusion. Once we had a good understanding of what the numbers were actually showing, AI helped us break down the conditional logic that would be required to print the entirety of the activation records based on what values are in the stack.
